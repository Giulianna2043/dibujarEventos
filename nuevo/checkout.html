Expedition – 29(C)</li><li>National Geographic Journeys with G Adventures – 29(D) </li></ul><p>Conditions of Carriage: If your Tour includes carriage by sea, the Conditions of Carriage available at www.gadventures.com/terms-conditions/conditions-of-carriage/ also apply to your Tour, are expressly incorporated into these Terms and form part of your booking contract with the Tour Operator.</p><p>By booking a Tour you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you make a booking on behalf of other participants, you guarantee that you have the authority to accept and do accept these Terms on behalf of the other participants in your party. </p><h4>1.	THE BOOKING CONTRACT</h4><p>Your booking is confirmed and a contract exists when the Tour Operator or your travel agent issues a written confirmation after receipt of the applicable deposit amount. Please check your confirmation carefully and report any incorrect or incomplete information to the Tour Operator or authorized agent immediately. Please ensure that names are exactly as stated in the relevant passport.</p><p>You must be at least 18 years of age to make a booking. You agree to provide full, complete and accurate information to the Tour Operator. </p><h4>2.	BOOKING ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</h4><p>By booking on behalf of other participants, you are deemed to be the designated contact person for every participant included on that booking. This means that you are responsible for making all payments due in connection with your Tour booking, notifying the Tour Operator or your travel agent if any changes or cancellations are required and keeping your party informed. </p><p>By booking on behalf of another person or persons, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all required consents. You are responsible for verifying that any information you provide on behalf of another participant is complete and accurate and the Tour Operator will under no circumstances be liable for any errors or omissions in the information provided to complete a booking. </p><h4>3.	REQUIRED MEDICAL INFORMATION</h4><p>You must provide any medical information reasonably requested by the Tour Operator and may be required to complete the Tour Operator’s medical information form (the “Medical Form”), available on the Tour Operator’s website at http://www.gadventures.com/medical_form. </p><p>Medical Forms are mandatory for certain Tours. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions which may impact their ability to travel, participate in a Tour, travel to remote areas without access to medical facilities or may adversely affect the experience of others on your Tour, you must return a Medical Form, signed by a licensed and practicing physician to the Tour Operator prior to or at the time of final payment for the applicable booking.</p><p>You agree to complete the Medical Form honestly and to disclose all relevant medical information accurately and fully. The Tour Operator will maintain the information in accordance with the Tour Operator’s Privacy Policy available at https://www.gadventures.com/terms-conditions/privacy/. </p><p>The Tour Operator reserves the right to request further information or professional medical opinions where necessary, as determined in its discretion, for your safety or the safe operation of a Tour. </p><p>The Tour Operator reserves the right to deny you permission to travel or participate in any aspect of a Tour at any time and at your own risk and expense where the Tour Operator determines that your physical or mental condition renders you unfit for travel or you represent a danger to yourself or others.</p><p>Pregnancy is considered a medical condition and must be disclosed to the Tour Operator at the time of booking. The Tour Operator may refuse to carry pregnant women over 24 weeks. The Tour Operator may refuse to carry anyone with certain medical conditions if reasonable accommodation or alternatives cannot be arranged.</p><p>In the event that you do not complete the required Medical Form or provide medical information reasonably required by the Tour Operator for any reason by the deadline indicated above, the Tour Operator reserves the right to cancel your booking and all applicable cancellation fees will apply.</p><p>You are responsible for assessing whether a Tour is suitable for you. You should consult your physician to confirm your fitness for travel and participation in any planned activities. You should seek your physician’s advice on vaccinations and medical precautions. The Tour Operator does not provide medical advice. It is your responsibility to assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on your own unique circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical requirements. </p><p>Travel with the Tour Operator may involve visiting remote or developing regions, where medical care may not be easily accessible and medical facilities may not meet the standards of those found in your home country. The condition of medical facilities in the countries you may visit on your Tour varies and the Tour Operator makes no representations and gives no warranties in relation to the availability or standard of medical facilities in those regions.</p><h4>4.	SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</h4><p>Any special requirements must be disclosed to the Tour Operator at the time of booking. The Tour Operator will use reasonable efforts to accommodate special requirements or requests but this is not always possible given the nature of the destinations visited and availability of options outside a planned itinerary. Certain activities may be inaccessible to you if your mobility is limited in any way. All food allergies and dietary restrictions must be disclosed to the Tour Operator at the time of booking but the Tour Operator cannot guarantee that dietary needs or restrictions can be accommodated. Any special requests or requirements do not form part of these Terms or the contract between you and the Tour Operator and the Tour Operator is not liable for any failure to accommodate or fulfill such requests. </p><h4>5.	AGE REQUIREMENTS</h4><p>Anyone under the age of 18 on the date of first travel is considered to be a minor. Minors must always be accompanied by an adult.  One adult may accompany up to two minors. Unless otherwise indicated in the Tour description or by the Tour Operator, the minimum age for minors travelling on any Tour is 12 years old.</p><p>All bookings with a minor are subject to review and approval by the Tour Operator. If the consent of a parent, guardian or any other person is required by applicable law for any minor to travel, the accompanying adult is responsible for securing all consents, documentation and ensuring that they and the minor(s) meet all legal requirements to travel, to enter into and depart from applicable countries and regions. The Tour Operator will not be responsible for any fees, damages, or losses incurred as a result of any failure to secure necessary consents, permits, and approvals. </p><p>Each adult on a booking with a minor or minor(s) is jointly and severally responsible for the behavior, wellbeing, supervision and monitoring of such minor(s), and jointly and severally accepts these Terms for and on behalf of any minor(s) on their booking, including all assumptions of risk and limitations of liability. The Tour Operator does not provide care services for minors and expressly disclaims any responsibility for chaperoning or controlling any minor(s).</p><h4>6.	MANDATORY INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS</h4><p><b>YOU MUST HAVE TRAVEL INSURANCE WITH A MINIMUM MEDICAL, EVACUATION AND REPATRIATION COVERAGE OF US$200,000</b> covering all applicable dates of travel with the Tour Operator. This insurance must cover personal injury and emergency medical expenses. On the first day of each Tour, a representative of the Tour Operator will verify that you have sufficient insurance in place. You are strongly recommended to extend your coverage to include cancellation, curtailment, and all other expenses that may arise as a result of loss, damage, injury, delay or inconvenience while traveling. You acknowledge that insurance coverage is not included in the cost of any Tour offered by the Tour Operator and you are required to obtain separate coverage at an additional cost. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient coverage and comply with the terms of the applicable insurance plans. You are responsible for advising your insurer of the type of travel, destination(s) and activities included in your booking so that the insurer may provide appropriate coverage.</p><h4>7.	PRICES, SURCHARGES AND TAXES</h4><p>The published price of the Tour and any products or services offered by the Tour Operator is subject to change at any time, before or after booking confirmation, up to 30 days before departure. Tours are priced and advertised exclusive of applicable sales taxes. After a confirmation invoice has been issued by the Tour Operator, the Tour Operator reserves the right to impose surcharges on any products or services booked for reasons arising from increases in transportation costs, fuel costs, dues, taxes or fees chargeable for services such as landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airport charges, local operator costs, currency and exchange fluctuations, increases in taxes, or government action which impacts the price of the applicable products or services; provided however, the Tour Operator will only do so where the increase in question is greater than 2% of the original price paid for the products or services (excluding add-ons, insurance, and taxes). Upon learning of the necessity to impose a surcharge in accordance with this section the Tour Operator will provide notice to you as soon as reasonably possible.</p><p>Where the increase in price is greater than 7% of the original price of the applicable products or services (excluding add-ons, insurance and taxes), you may choose to either:<br><br>
(a) cancel the applicable booking without incurring any penalty; or<br><br>
(b) accept the change of price.</p><p>You must notify the Tour Operator of your choice within 14 days of receipt of notice of the increase or you will be deemed to have accepted the price change and will be liable for payment of the increase.</p><p>From time-to-time the Tour Operator may offer reduced pricing on certain products or services. Reduced pricing applies only to new bookings. Bookings where payment of at least a deposit has been received by the Tour Operator are not entitled to reduced pricing.</p><h4>8.	VALIDITY</h4><p>All dates, itineraries and prices of Tours are subject to change at any time and the current price will be quoted and confirmed at the time of booking, subject to any surcharges that may be levied in accordance these Terms. </p><p>You acknowledge that you are responsible for keeping up to date on the specific details of your Tour and any other products or services, including, but not limited to checking the Tour Operator’s website at least 72 hours prior to departure as minor changes may have been made after the time of booking.</p><h4>9.	DEPOSITS</h4><p>At the time of booking, a non-refundable deposit of USD$250, GBP£100, EUR€250, CAD$250, AUD$250, CHF250, ZAR1000 or NZD$250, as applicable, per person per Tour is due to the Tour Operator. If the booking is made 60 days or less prior to departure, full payment is due at the time of booking. The non-refundable deposit should be sent to the Tour Operator or authorized agent, as applicable. </p><p>Certain products of services the Tour Operator, including bookings on the M.S. Expedition [include anchor link to bottom], may require you to provide a higher deposit of make full payment at the time of booking. The Tour Operator will advise you of any such requirements prior to confirmation of the applicable booking.</p><p>Lifetime Deposits: If you cancel your booking, and that cancellation is not a result of nonpayment or any other breach of these Terms, the deposit amount will be held as a “Lifetime Deposit” with the Tour Operator, subject to these Terms. Lifetime Deposits have no expiry and may be applied towards payment of a deposit on any other Tour offered by the Tour Operator. The Lifetime Deposit is transferable and may be transferred by you to another individual of your choosing by providing notice to the Tour Operator in writing. </p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, only the deposit amount will form part of the Lifetime Deposit. The Lifetime Deposit has no cash value. Only one Lifetime Deposit may be applied per person per product booked. A Lifetime Deposit must be applied to a new Tour booking that is of equal or greater value to the cancelled Tour for which the Lifetime Deposit was originally received. A Lifetime Deposit may not be applied to the same or similar dates of travel. </p><h4>10.	DETAILS REQUIRED FOR BOOKING</h4><p>As a condition of booking, you must provide the information requested by the Tour Operator along with final payment. If you fail to provide all required information prior to the date on which full payment is due, an administrative fee will be charged for any costs incurred by the Tour Operator as a result of your failure to provide the required information. If you fail to supply information required by the Tour Operator for air tickets, permits, or other inclusions, you will also be liable for any costs, fees or losses including failure to obtain or provide that inclusion. In the event that you fail to supply information required by the Tour Operator, the Tour Operator also reserves the right to treat your booking (or the relevant component of your booking) as cancelled and levy any cancellation fees deemed reasonable by the Tour Operator, in its sole discretion. The information required by the Tour Operator will vary by Tour and will be communicated to you or to the Tour Operator’s authorized agent during the booking process. The Tour Operator will not be held responsible for any fees you incur as a result of errors, omissions, inaccuracies, late, misplaced or otherwise incomplete information you have provided.</p><h4>11.	AIRFARE</h4><p>Tour prices do not include international or other airfare unless expressly mentioned in the Tour’s descriptions. The Tour Operator will quote the best price available for the travel dates requested at the time the quote is prepared. Quotes provide an estimate only and are not a firm price commitment by the Tour Operator or the applicable air carrier(s). </p><p>The Tour Operator acts only as a sales agent for the applicable air carrier and the air carrier terms and conditions apply to the purchase and use of the air travel ticket. Please consult the air carrier’s applicable terms and conditions and conditions of carriage for complete information including applicable cancellation terms. The Tour Operator is not responsible for changes in air itineraries or flight times and does not provide advice or alerts regarding air travel tickets, flight status or delays.</p><h4>12.	FINAL PAYMENT &amp; ACCEPTANCE OF BOOKING</h4><p>The confirmation sent by the Tour Operator or your travel agent will contain details of final payment required for any booking. Payment of the balance of the price for any products or services booked (excluding M.S. Expedition [Anchor link] and custom-tailored products or services) is due 60 days before the departure date of the first product or service included in the applicable booking. If full payment is not received by the applicable due date, the Tour Operator may, at its sole discretion, change the rate payable for the booking, or treat the booking as cancelled and retain the deposit paid on booking as a cancellation fee. If a booking is made less than 60 days before the departure date of the first product included in the applicable booking, then the full amount must be paid at the time of booking. If, for any product or service booked, payment terms differ from those outlined in this section, the applicable terms will be communicated to you prior to booking and will also be detailed on the applicable invoice.</p><p>The Tour Operator is not responsible for any charges levied by third parties or financial institutions and payable by you as a result of credit card or other payment transactions and will not refund or return any fees charged by third parties or financial institutions in connection with payments made by you to the Tour Operator.</p><h4>13.	CANCELLATION BY THE PARTICIPANT</h4><p>You may cancel your booking by notifying the Tour Operator. Cancellation fees, if any, will be determined with reference to the date on which notice of cancellation is received by the Tour Operator and are expressed as a percentage of the total price paid for the cancelled Tour, product or service (excluding any insurance products).</p><p>Cancellation of a Tour:<br><br>
(a)	Cancellation received 60 days or more before departure of first product or service in relevant booking: Lifetime Deposit will be held by the Tour Operator in accordance with these Terms, the remainder of the payments made to the Tour Operator in respect of the cancelled product will be refunded.<br><br>

(b)	Cancellation received 59-30 days before departure of first product or service in relevant booking: Lifetime Deposit will be held by the Tour Operator in accordance with these Terms, an amount equal to 50% of the remainder of the payments made to the Tour Operator in respect of the cancelled Tour will be refunded.<br><br>

(c)	Cancellation less than 30 days before departure of first product or service in relevant booking: Lifetime Deposit will be held by the Tour Operator in accordance with these Terms, and no further refund will be payable.</p><p>For certain products of services the Tour Operator, including bookings on or related to the M.S. Expedition [include anchor link to bottom], alternative cancellation terms may apply. The Tour Operator will advise you of any such requirements prior to confirmation of the applicable booking.</p><p>Cancellation of Arrival Transfers, Pre and Post Night Accommodations, My Own Room and optional activities booked directly with the Tour Operator:<br><br>

(b)	Cancellation 30 days or less before departure: No refund will be payable in respect of any cancelled Arrival Transfers, Pre and Post Night Accommodations, My Own Room and optional activities.</p><h4>14.	GUARANTEED DEPARTURES &amp; CANCELLATION OF A TOUR BY THE TOUR OPERATOR</h4><p>A departure date for a Tour offered by the Tour Operator will become a guaranteed departure when at least one booking secured by a valid deposit has been made on that departure. </p><p>The Tour Operator guarantees that all scheduled Tour departures booked and secured with a valid deposit will depart as indicated on the applicable confirmation, subject to reasonably itinerary changes as described in these Terms or good faith health and safety concerns. This guarantee is not applicable in the case of Force Majeure. Up to date Tour and itinerary information is available on the Tour Operator’s website or by contacting the Tour Operator.

Standards of hygiene, accommodation and transport in certain countries where Tours take place are often lower than the standards you may reasonably expect in your home country or region. You agree that the Tour Operator is not responsible for providing information or guidance with respect to local customs, weather conditions, specific safety concerns, physical challenges or laws in effect in any locations where a Tour, product or service is operated. You acknowledge you have considered the potential risks, dangers and challenges and your own personal capabilities and needs, and you expressly assume the risks associated with travel under such conditions.</p><p>You must at all times strictly comply with all applicable laws and regulations of all countries and regions. Should you fail to comply with the above or commit any illegal act when on Tour or, if in the opinion of the Tour Operator (acting reasonably), your behavior is causing or is likely to cause danger, distress or material annoyance to others, the Tour Operator may terminate your travel arrangements on any product or service immediately at your expense and without any liability on the Tour Operator’s part. You will not be entitled to any refund for unused or missed services or costs incurred as a result of termination of your travel arrangements, including, without limitation, return travel, accommodations, meals, and incidentals.</p><p>You are responsible for any costs (including repair, replacement and cleaning fees) incurred by the Tour Operator or the Tour Operator’s suppliers for property damage, destruction or theft caused by you while on a Tour.

Neither the Tour Operator nor its Third Party Suppliers (as defined herein) are liable for loss or damages caused by your failure to comply with safety instructions or warnings.</p><p>You agree to bring any complaints to the Tour Operator as soon as possible in order to provide the Tour Operator with the opportunity to properly address such complaint.

Any complaint made after the completion of a Tour must be received in writing by the Tour Operator within 30 days of the last day of travel of the booking in question.</p><h4>19.

Third Party Suppliers may also engage the services of local operators and sub-contractors. Although the Tour Operator takes all reasonable care in selecting Third Party Suppliers, the Tour Operator is unable to control Third Party Suppliers, does not supervise Third Party Suppliers and therefore cannot be responsible for their acts or omissions. Any services provided by Third Party Suppliers are subject to the terms and conditions imposed by these Third Party Suppliers and their liability is limited by their tariffs, conditions of carriage, tickets and vouchers and international conventions and agreements that govern the provision of their services. These may limit or exclude liability of the Third Party Supplier.

You agree that any assistance given by the Tour Operator’s representative(s) in arranging, selecting, or booking, any Optional Extras is purely at your request and the Tour Operator makes no warranties and expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever arising from participation in Optional Extras or any information provided by any representative of the Tour Operator regarding any Optional Extras. You release the Tour Operator from all claims and causes of action arising from any damages, loss of enjoyment, inconvenience, or injuries related to or arising from participation in or booking of Optional Extras.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that any liability for loss, damages, death, personal injury, illness, emotional distress, mental suffering or psychological injury or loss of or damage to property associated with Optional Extras is the sole responsibility of the third party providing that service or activity.</p><h4>21.

You waive any claim against the Tour Operator for any such loss, damage, injury, or death. </p><p>In the event that any loss, death, injury or illness is caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the Tour Operator or of the Third Party Suppliers of any services which form part of the booking contract then the Tour Operator limits its liability, where applicable by all applicable international conventions.</p><p>Carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea is governed by the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea (PAL), as amended (the “Athens Convention”) which is expressly incorporated into these Terms and any liability of the Tour Operator and the Carrier (as that term is defined in the Athens Convention) for death or personal injury or for loss or damage to luggage arising out of carriage by sea will be determined solely in accordance with this Convention. The Athens Convention limits the Carrier’s liability for death or personal injury or loss or damage to luggage and makes special provision for valuables. It presumes that luggage has been delivered undamaged to the Guest unless written notice is given to the Tour Operator and/or the Carrier:<br><br>

(a)	in the case of apparent damage, before or at the time of disembarkation or redelivery; or<br><br>

(b)	in the case of damage which is not apparent or of loss, within 15 days from the date of disembarkation or redelivery or from the time when such redelivery should have taken place.</p><p>Any damage payable by the Tour Operator up to the Athens Convention limits will be reduced in proportion to any contributory negligence by you and by the maximum deductible specified in Article 8 (4) of the Athens Convention. Copies of the Athens Convention are available from the Tour Operator on request.</p><p>In so far as the Tour Operator may be liable to you in respect of claims arising out of carriage by sea, the Tour Operator is entitled to all the rights, defenses, immunities and limitations available, respectively, to the actual carrier and under the relevant Conventions, and nothing in these Terms will be deemed as a surrender thereof. To the extent that any provision in these Terms is made null and void by the Athens Convention or any legislation compulsorily applicable or is otherwise unenforceable, it shall be void to that extent but not further. The Tour Operator’s liability will not at any time exceed that of the carrier under its Conditions of Carriage and applicable or incorporated conventions or other legislation. Any liability in respect of death and personal injury and loss of and damage to luggage which the Tour Operator may incur, whether under the contract with you in accordance with these Terms or otherwise, will always be subject to the limits of liability contained in the Athens Convention for death or personal injury.</p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in these Terms, the Tour Operator will not in any circumstances be liable to you for any loss or anticipated loss of profit, loss of enjoyment, loss of revenue, loss of use, loss of contract or other opportunity nor for any other consequential or indirect loss or damage of a similar nature.</p><p>For claims not involving personal injury, death or illness or which are not subject to the Conventions referred to above, any liability the Tour Operator may incur for the negligent acts or omissions of its suppliers will be limited to a maximum of the price which you paid for the applicable Tour, not including insurance premiums and administration charges. Where this relates to loss or damage to luggage and other personal possessions then the Tour Operator liability will not exceed $1,000 CAD. The Tour Operator will not at any time be liable for any loss of or damage to valuables of any nature. You agree that you will be precluded from making a double recovery by making the same claims and seeking recovery against the Tour Operator and its suppliers, contractors or other third parties.</p><h4>22.	FORCE MAJEURE</h4><p>The Tour Operator will not be liable in any way for death, bodily injury, illness, damage, delay or other loss or detriment to person or property, or financial costs both direct and indirect incurred, or for the Tour Operator failure to commence, perform or complete any duty owed to you if such death, delay, bodily injury (including emotional distress or injury), illness, damage or other loss or detriment to person or property is caused by Act of God, war or war like operations, mechanical breakdowns, terrorist activities or threat thereof, civil commotions, labor difficulties, interference by authorities, political disturbance, howsoever and where so ever any of the same may arise or be caused, riot, insurrection and government restraint, fire, extreme weather or any other cause whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of the Tour Operator; or an event which the Tour Operator or the Third Party Supplier of services, even with all due care, could not foresee any and all of which, individually and collectively, constitute “Force Majeure”.</p><h4>23.

By submitting any personal information to the Tour Operator, you indicate your acceptance of the Tour Operator’s Privacy Policy.</p><h4>25.	SEVERABILITY</h4><p>If any provision of these Terms is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
